    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Creamy Mushroom Pasta speaks for itself. A slippery tangle of pasta bathed in a creamy parmesan sauce loaded with buttery garlic mushrooms, it's simple, quick, and utterly luxurious!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>160g/6oz fettucine</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>300g/10oz mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) white wine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) chicken broth/stock</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (185 ml) cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (30g) parmesan</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SERVING:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra parmesan</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute less than time per packet (start this mid mushroom cook). Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup cooking water, then drain.</li>
        <li>Melt butter and heat oil in a large skillet over high heat.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms and cook, stirring regularly. When they start to sweat, add a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>When pretty golden (about 4 - 5 minutes), add garlic and cook until garlic is golden and mushroom is golden.</li>
        <li>Stand back and add wine (it will be steamy!!), stir, scraping the bottom of the skillet. Simmer rapidly until wine is mostly evaporated and winey smell is gone.</li>
        <li>Add broth, cream, parmesan, salt and pepper. Stir to dissolve parmesan and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
        <li>Transfer pasta into sauce, toss for 1 - 2 minutes until sauce thickens and coats pasta. If sauce gets too thick (rather than slick, see video), add a splash of reserved pasta cooking water.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with extra parmesan!</li>
    </ol>
